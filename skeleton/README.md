# Skeleton code

## Files

Any file beginning with cin will use __\<iostream\>__ to do I/O. Otherwise, assume it uses __\<stdio.h\>__.

The reason for this is that in testing, the __\<stdio.h\>__ headers seemed to perform better.

_read\_n.cpp_ reads in an integer, n from stdin, then reads n numbers into a vector, which can later be operated on. 

_operate\_n.cpp_ reads in an integer, n from stdin, then reads n number from stdin, passing each n to a function.

_knapsack .cpp_ is a simple implementation of the knapsack problem. It could be adapted for any backtracking though
